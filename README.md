The Tumblr Times
================

The New York Times has so many cool APIs that you can basically rebuild your Tumblr dashboard with them. I wanted to do the opposite; Tumblr news (and cats) in old school, dead tree newsprint. Thus was born The Tumblr Times at the 2012 TimesOpen Hackathon. Grab a Tumblr API key, throw this code into the cloud, and hit print (in landscape mode)!
